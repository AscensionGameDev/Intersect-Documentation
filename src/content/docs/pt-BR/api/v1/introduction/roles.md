title: API Roles
---

API roles are special API permissions that you can assign to an account. Having basic API access does not allow you to work with user information or manage user emails/passwords, for example.

There are three server commands for dealing with api roles.

Granting an api role:
`apigrant [username] [role]`

Revoking an api role:
`apirevoke [username] [role]`

List api roles for an account:
`apiroles [username]`

## UserQuery

Grants read-access to the Users endpoints.

## UserManage

Allows access to the Change Email/Password endpoints for Users without needing to know the users' existing password.
