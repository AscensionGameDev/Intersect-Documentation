Intersects editor uses various 3rd party libraries including DockPanelSuite with dozens of Win32 API calls which does not allow it to be ran on other operating systems. These libraries play a key role in making Intersect user friendly which is why we are not and likely never will pursue cross platform compatability with the editor program.



## Licensing & Cost (100% Free!)
You are allowed to create games with Intersect and distribute, sell, or otherwise make money off your games for free. Intersect is split into 3 major components which are the Game Client (MIT), the Editor (GPL) and the Server (GPL).

The only reason we have slightly more restrictive licensing on our Editor and Server components is so that we can dissuade other developers from selling our engine without disclosing their source changes.
