# Survol de l'éditeur
![Game Editor](http://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/c399bc35aad37d828ddda1986538e7bd.png)

Notre éditeur est très avancé et peut être, au commencement, assez intimidant. Cette page fournira rapidement tous les noms de chacun des panneaux/zones et procurera un survol sur leur utilité.

&nbsp;

L'éditeur de carte
---------------------------
Commençons par la grande section au centre. C'est l'éditeur de carte, contrairement à l'image haut dessus, votre carte est probablement vide.

Working with the Map Layers panel on the left you can place tiles from tilesets on your map to start designing your game world.
En travaillant avec le panneau des couches de carte à gauche

>- Select **Tiles** in the **Map Layers** pane.
>- Use your mouse to select a tile or group of tiles to place in your empty map. <a href="http://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/03856cde2da1c67f07b0123b90b6b0dc.gif" data-lity><i class="fa fa-play-circle"></i></a>

We won't go in depth about the map editor here, for more information see: World Design

&nbsp;

Map Layers
---------------------------
This is the area where you select different tiles, attributes, lights, events, and npcs to place on the map.

![Map Layers](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/ffcf5ccf19de31db8389a08b9bafea3c.png)

- Tiles are the graphics that actually make up the game world.
- Attributes are placed on top of the tiles and tell the game how the player can interact with them. Attributes include blocks (to prevent players from reaching unwanted areas), warps (to move a player inside houses or to different parts of the world), animations, and more!
- Lights are lights. Eventually you will configure how you want time to pass in your game and if you want your game to get dark at night. If so, you can place lights on the map to provide some really cool effects.
- Events are pretty complex. We will touch up on those later. In short they help you create your game's story, interactions with npcs, provide quests, puzzles, and so much more!
- The NPC tab is last but not least, this is how you add combatable entities/monsters/bosses to your game world. More on that later.

&nbsp;

Map List
---------------------------
A large game may have dozens or hundreds of maps. The map list is where you can navigate to and organize the maps you have created.

![Map List](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/fd600e2516e3b6a54193c5ce5bfce958.png)

Double clicking a map on this list will open that map for you to edit. You can create folders, re-order maps, rename maps, and delete maps on this list.

&nbsp;

Map Properties
---------------------------
![Map Properties](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/6fa0203860907911f251ed13f174b7d2.png)

The map properties pane allows you to customize various settings for your map such as background music, the map name, weather options, whether or not the map is a combat zone, lighting, and more.

&nbsp;

Menu Bar
---------------------------
![Menu Bar](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/f951597a65ac34164090c46e3a640680.png)

The menu bar at the top of your editor is your gateway to everything else our engine has to offer. The bottom row consists of all sorts of mapping tools that are discussed in the World Design page. The **File**, **Edit**, and **View** drop downs all offer various mapping options that you don't need to worry about right now.

The important components of the Menu Bar are the **Game Editors** drop down and the **Help** menu.

The **Game Editors** drop down will give you easy access to modify all the other major components of your game.

Extra Notes
---------------------------
Now is probably a good time to note a nifty feature we recently added to Intersect. Open your **File** -> **Options** menu. Here you can click the **Browse** button and select your **Intersect Client.exe**.

After doing so, you will be able to hit the green play icon ![Play Icon](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/b793679bc50386069948727977d26ad5.png) in the menu bar to launch your client at any time!
